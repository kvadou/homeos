 * HomeOS is doing:
 *   - noticed     → an observation about the present ("I noticed")
 *   - learned     → something newly understood ("I've learned")
 *   - predicts    → a forward-looking estimate ("Here's what I expect")
 *   - found       → surfaced/linked existing info ("I found")
 *   - remembers   → recalling the home's history ("I remember")
 *   - interesting → a delightful, low-stakes observation ("Here's something interesting")
