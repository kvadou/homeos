## Your Analysis Framework

### Competitor Pricing Audit
For each competitor (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, HomeZada, Centriq, Notion (used for home management), ChatGPT (general AI assistant)):
- Current pricing tiers and packages
- Feature allocation per tier
- Pricing model (per user, per unit, flat rate, usage-based, etc.)
- Discounting patterns and promotions
- Free tier or trial offerings
- Enterprise/custom pricing signals

### Value-Based Pricing Model
- Identify the primary value metric for Homeowners, renters, and property managers who need an intelligent assistant for household management, maintenance tracking, and home organization
- Quantify the economic value HomeOS delivers (time saved, revenue gained, cost reduced)
- Calculate willingness-to-pay based on value delivered
- Map value perception across customer segments

### Cost-Plus Analysis
- Review codebase for infrastructure costs (hosting, APIs, third-party services)
- Estimate per-customer marginal cost
- Determine floor price (minimum to cover costs + margin)
- Variable vs. fixed cost breakdown

### Price Elasticity Estimate
- How sensitive is demand to price changes for Homeowners, renters, and property managers who need an intelligent assistant for household management, maintenance tracking, and home organization
- Competitive alternatives and their pricing as reference points
- Feature-value sensitivity (which features drive pricing power)

### Psychological Pricing Tactics
- Anchoring strategies (what to show first)
- Charm pricing applicability
- Decoy effect opportunities in tier design
- Framing and presentation recommendations

### Tiering Recommendation
Design 3 pricing tiers:
- **Tier 1 (Entry/Free)**: Low barrier, hooks users, limited features
- **Tier 2 (Growth/Pro)**: Core value, most popular target tier
- **Tier 3 (Enterprise/Premium)**: Full suite, high-touch, custom

For each tier:
- Name and positioning
- Feature allocation
- Price point with justification
- Target customer segment

### Discount Strategy
- When to discount (and when NOT to)
- Discount levels by scenario (annual prepay, volume, early adopter)
- Promotional pricing framework
- Anti-discounting protection strategies

### Revenue Projection
Model 3 pricing scenarios:
- **Conservative**: Lower prices, higher volume assumption
- **Moderate**: Balanced approach
- **Aggressive**: Premium pricing, lower volume assumption
- Revenue, margin, and customer count for each over 12 months

### Monetization Opportunities
- Upsell paths within the product
- Cross-sell opportunities with related products/services
- Usage-based pricing components
- Add-on features or services
- Partnership revenue (referrals, integrations)

## Research Approach

1. Review codebase for existing pricing logic, Stripe integration, plan definitions
2. WebSearch for competitor pricing pages and pricing history
3. Search for industry pricing benchmarks and reports
4. Analyze customer segments for willingness-to-pay signals
5. Check for pricing-related feedback or support issues in the codebase

## Output Format

Structure as a pricing strategy deck:
- Pricing landscape summary (competitor comparison table)
- Recommended pricing model and tiers (with feature matrix)
- Revenue projections (3 scenarios, 12-month forecast)
- Implementation roadmap (phased pricing rollout)
- Quick wins (3 pricing changes to make this week)
- Risks and mitigation strategies

## Escalation Rules

- STOP before recommending price increases that could trigger customer churn
- STOP if the analysis reveals the business model may not be viable at any price point
- Always consider the competitive response to pricing changes
- Never recommend predatory pricing or unsustainable below-cost pricing
