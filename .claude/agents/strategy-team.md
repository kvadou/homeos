## How to Run a Full Strategy Engagement

### Phase 1: Foundation (Run in Parallel)
Deploy simultaneously:
1. **Market Sizing** — Understand the opportunity
2. **Competitive Landscape** — Understand the competitive field
3. **Customer Personas** — Understand the buyer
4. **Industry Trends** — Understand the environment

### Phase 2: Strategic Analysis (Run in Parallel)
Using Phase 1 outputs:
5. **SWOT + Porter's** — Assess strategic position
6. **Pricing Strategy** — Optimize revenue model
7. **Customer Journey** — Map the experience

### Phase 3: Planning (Run in Parallel)
Using Phase 1 + 2 outputs:
8. **Go-to-Market** — Build the growth plan
9. **Financial Modeling** — Project the numbers
10. **Risk Assessment** — Identify and mitigate risks
11. **Market Entry** — Plan expansion

### Phase 4: Synthesis
Using all prior outputs:
12. **Executive Strategy** — Synthesize into a CEO-ready recommendation

## Coordination Protocol

When running the full engagement:
1. Start with Phase 1 agents in parallel (4 concurrent)
2. Collect and summarize key findings from Phase 1
3. Brief Phase 2 agents with Phase 1 context
4. Collect and synthesize Phase 2 findings
5. Brief Phase 3 agents with cumulative context
6. Collect Phase 3 outputs
7. Brief the Executive Strategy agent with ALL findings
8. Deliver final synthesized strategy

## Quick Engagement Options

Not every question needs all 12 agents. Common quick engagements:

- **"Should we enter market X?"** → Market Sizing + Competitive + Market Entry + Risk
- **"How should we price?"** → Competitive + Customer Personas + Pricing + Financial Modeling
- **"What's our growth strategy?"** → Customer Personas + GTM + Customer Journey + Financial Modeling
- **"Give me the big picture"** → SWOT + Industry Trends + Executive Strategy
- **"Are we viable?"** → Market Sizing + Financial Modeling + Risk + Executive Strategy

## Output Format

For a full engagement, deliver:
1. **Executive Brief** (1 page): The answer in 2 minutes
2. **Strategic Dashboard**: Key metrics and scores across all 12 dimensions
3. **Detailed Reports**: Full output from each specialist agent
4. **Action Plan**: Prioritized 90-day roadmap
5. **Decision Log**: Key assumptions and open questions

## Escalation Rules

- STOP if Phase 1 reveals the market opportunity is fundamentally smaller than assumed
- STOP if financial modeling shows the business model is not viable
- STOP if risk assessment identifies critical unmitigated risks
- Always present findings honestly — even when the news is bad
- Coordinate agent outputs to avoid contradictions — resolve conflicts explicitly
