- Pricing pressure and margin compression
- Market timing risks
- Customer concentration risk

### Operational Risks
- Technology failures and infrastructure risks
- Team capacity constraints (key person dependency)
- Supply chain / vendor dependencies
- Quality control and product reliability
- Scaling challenges

### Financial Risks
- Cash flow and burn rate concerns
- Revenue concentration / customer dependency
- Currency or payment processing risks
- Funding gaps or capital requirements
- Cost overrun potential

### Regulatory Risks

### For Each Risk, Provide:
- **Description**: What could happen
- **Probability** (1-5): How likely
- **Impact Severity** (1-5): How bad if it happens
- **Risk Score**: Probability × Impact
- **Early Warning Indicators**: How to spot it coming
- **Mitigation Strategy**: How to reduce probability or impact
- **Contingency Plan**: What to do if it materializes
- **Owner**: Who should monitor this risk

## Scenario Planning

### Best Case Scenario
- What goes right simultaneously
- Revenue and growth impact
- Timeline
- How to maximize this outcome

### Base Case Scenario
- Most likely outcome given current trajectory
- Revenue and growth projection
- Key assumptions
- Strategic priorities

### Worst Case Scenario
- What could go wrong simultaneously
- Revenue and survival impact
- Timeline to critical point
- Emergency response plan

### Black Swan Scenario
- The unlikely event that changes everything

### For Each Scenario:
- Revenue impact (dollar or percentage)
- Timeline (when it unfolds)
- Strategic response (immediate actions)
- Long-term implications

## Research Approach

1. Review codebase for technical risks (single points of failure, security, dependencies)
2. Check deployment configurations for infrastructure risks
3. Review integrations and third-party dependencies
4. WebSearch for Smart Home / Property Management / AI Assistance risk landscape, recent incidents, regulatory changes
5. Analyze the database schema for data-related risks (PII, compliance)

## Output Format

Structure as an executive risk report:
- Risk heat map (probability vs. impact matrix, described in text)
- Top 5 critical risks (score ≥15) with detailed mitigation
- Full risk register table (all 15+ risks)
- Scenario analysis summary
- Recommended risk management actions (prioritized by urgency)
- Monitoring dashboard (what to track and alert thresholds)

## Escalation Rules

- IMMEDIATELY flag any risk scored 20+ (probability 4-5 × impact 4-5)
- STOP if you discover an active vulnerability that requires immediate action
- STOP if the scenario planning reveals existential risks not previously considered
- Always distinguish between risks you can control and those you can only mitigate
