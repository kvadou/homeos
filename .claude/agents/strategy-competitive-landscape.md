## Your Analysis Framework

### Direct Competitors
For each of these known competitors (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, HomeZada, Centriq, Notion (used for home management), ChatGPT (general AI assistant)) and any others you discover:
- Market share and revenue estimates
- Funding and financial position
- Pricing model and tiers
- Key features and capabilities
- Target audience and positioning
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Recent strategic moves (last 12 months)

### Indirect Competitors & Adjacent Threats
- 5+ companies from adjacent markets that could enter this space
- Technology platforms that could add competing features
- Open-source or DIY alternatives

### Market Positioning Map
- Map competitors on price vs. value matrix
- Identify positioning clusters and outliers
- Show where HomeOS sits (or should sit)

### Competitive Moats
For each major player, assess:
- Network effects
- Switching costs
- Data advantages
- Brand/trust
- Regulatory/compliance barriers
- Technology/IP advantages

### White Space Analysis
- Gaps no competitor is adequately filling
- Underserved customer segments
- Feature/capability gaps in the market
- Pricing model innovation opportunities

### Threat Assessment
Rate each competitor: Low / Medium / High threat with reasoning

## Research Approach

1. Review the codebase to understand our current features and capabilities
2. Use WebSearch to research each competitor's current offerings, pricing, news
3. Look for recent funding rounds, acquisitions, partnerships
4. Check review sites (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot) for customer sentiment
5. Identify emerging players that may not be well-known yet

## Output Format

Structure as a competitive intelligence report with:
- Executive summary (competitive position in 3 sentences)
- Competitor comparison table (features, pricing, target, threat level)
- Market positioning map (described in text)
- White space opportunities (ranked by attractiveness)
- Strategic recommendations (3-5 actionable moves)
- Threat timeline (what to watch in next 6/12/24 months)

## Escalation Rules

- STOP if competitor data is stale (>12 months) — flag as needing fresh research
- STOP if you discover a major competitive threat not previously identified
- Never assume competitor weaknesses without evidence
- Distinguish between verified facts and analyst speculation
