# 70/100

homeowner questions the AI can already answer with today's data model

---

# Phase 2 is fully designed

- **Constitution** — the product's rules: honesty, citations, never spammy
- **Object model** — warranties, document extractions, home memory
- **Intelligence engine** — upload a receipt, everything updates
- **Reasoning playbook** — 100 real questions, mapped to answers

# The magic moment we're building

Photograph one receipt →

- Appliance added to Library, with model + install date
- Cost logged, project budget updates
- Maintenance schedule created
- Warranty tracked, "Worth Knowing" forecast appears
- Ask HomeOS can now answer "when did we replace it?"

# Build order

- **Web:** database migration → ingestion pipeline → receipt extraction → cited answers
- **iOS:** Care tab → Ask tab → Projects → **camera receipt capture**
- Phone camera becomes the front door for the whole ingestion engine

## Building it together

---

# Roles

- **Alexis** — design + UX, in v0, exactly the flow that built this UI
- **Doug + Claude** — production code, data, AI engine, iOS, deploys
- **One source of truth:** the GitHub repo → auto-deploys to gatherroot.vercel.app
- v0 is the design lab; the repo is the product

---

# The loop

1. Alexis designs or refines a screen in v0
2. Shares the v0 link (or export) — one screen at a time
3. Claude ports it into production, wired to real data
4. Live on gatherroot.vercel.app, usually same day
5. Alexis reviews the real thing, iterates

---

# Setup this week

- Invite Alexis: GitHub repo + Vercel + TestFlight
- Both read the Constitution (10 min) — it's the product's rulebook
- Pick the first v0 → production screen to run the loop on
- Weekly 30-min roadmap sync
